excerpt: 'The FAIR bioHeaders Reference genome (FHR) aims to address the lack of interoperable data standards in reference genome data-sharing platforms, enhancing cross-platform analysis and mitigating data provenance loss by providing an extensive metadata standard guided by FAIR principles alongside Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology principles, ensuring easy implementation while maintaining extensibility and expressivity in a decentralized genomic data ecosystem.'

The lack of interoperable data standards among reference genome data-sharing platforms inhibits cross-platform analysis while increasing the risk of data provenance loss. Here, we describe the FAIR bioHeaders Reference genome (FHR), a metadata standard guided by the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse (FAIR) in addition to the principles of Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability and Technology. The objective of FHR is to provide an extensive set of data serialisation methods and minimum data field requirements while still maintaining extensibility, flexibility and expressivity in an increasingly decentralised genomic data ecosystem. The effort needed to implement FHR is low; FHRâ€™s design philosophy ensures easy implementation while retaining the benefits gained from recording both machine and human-readable provenance.
